## Wednesday 17.3
1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet).
What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?
What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?
What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.
Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).

Most of the core classes are implemented, this including Weight, Scale, Stack,
FileManager, Game, State, Grid ... the console and graphical version of the game
are also mostly completed. The algorithms are also implemented and run as
planned, however, more testing will be needed.

All the basic methods and attributes of the core classes are tested using the
console version of the program. They all work as expected, however, more testing
maybe needed when linking them together.

Implementing the algorithms require a refactoring of the players action, which
means a new Command class is needed. All the traits are refactored to
Traits.scala. Constants and helper functions are also refactored. The random()
and bestMove() produce a lot of bugs and took quite some time to making it work.

Trying to get the GameCanvas to pan and zoom at the mouse location is much
harder than expected. It took me a couple hours to get it done.

I have work for an approximate of 20 hours on the project since I want to get it
done as fast as possible.

I think I am ahead of the project plan.

## Wednesday 31.3

Most of the program has already been fully implemented, however, visually the UI
interface is very unstructured. The UI elements has been changed and the layout
has been modified to be more fitting to the eye.  Zooming and panning is also
updated to not over-zoom and over-pan. Some click registering issues when
placing the weight are also fixed. There was not a lot of progress made since
the last report.

Testing is done mostly on the GUI. A lof of time was spent micro-tuning the UI.
The UI logic that identify the user's click on the canvas and placing the weight
accordingly encountered some bugs and took some time to debug.

During this period, I spent 1 full session of 6 hours to code the project.

I think I am a head of the project plan.


## Wednesday 14.4

Not a lot of progress was made during this period due to overlapping courses and
the evaluation week comming up.

I think I am behind of the project plan now. There are still the project
document. The game also need a visual upgrade, colored block and white
background is not visually appealing.
